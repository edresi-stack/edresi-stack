## Hi there 👋
# 🧬 Osama Aledresi
Medical Laboratory Specialist & Medical AI Systems Engineer

I design **intelligent, explainable, and production-oriented health-tech systems**
that bridge clinical logic, laboratory operations, and real-world hospital constraints.

## 🚀 Flagship Systems

### 🧠 VitaGuard AI  
**Explainable Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)**  
*Clinical Intelligence*

- Real-time integration of laboratory results, vital signs, and medication context
- Hybrid AI engine (tree-based + temporal models)
- Built-in clinical rationale trace (Explainable AI)
- Dual-language medical reporting (Arabic / English)

🔒 Production codebase is private due to clinical data sensitivity  
🔗 Public system architecture & logic showcase:

### 🧪 LabOptimizer AI  
**Next-Generation LIS Middleware & Laboratory Operations Engine**  
*Operational & Financial Intelligence*

- Intelligent HL7 (MLLP) middleware connecting analyzers to inventory & finance
- Physics-aware reagent consumption modeling (R1 / R2 / wash / calibration)
- Real-time inventory decrement & stability monitoring
- Financial pulse engine calculating true per-test profitability
- Predictive stock depletion alerts

🔒 Production codebase is private due to operational data sensitivity

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Medical AI Systems & Clinical Logic
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- LIS & Laboratory Middleware Architecture
- HL7 / Analyzer Integration
- Workflow & Financial Automation

## 🧪 Design Philosophy

> I don’t build software that merely records data.  
> I build systems that **understand how medicine and laboratories actually work**.
